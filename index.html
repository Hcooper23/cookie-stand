        <p> Welcome to the Sam Bam Cookies page, we would like to introduce you to this amazing concept we have to offer
            not
            only amazing for you but also the environment. Our products are not only amazing cookies but also
            environmental safe and have been
            designed with both the customer and the environment in mind. It all began as a children for me and wife, we
            both loved the ocean that is actually where we meet. One day me and her had been out for a nice evening walk
            when we saw a poor fish washed-up on shore that had a wrapper from a oreo package stuck half way in its
            mouth. Presuming it attempted to swallow it and it got caught and stuck which may have caused it to
            suffocate. With me and her both being avid outdoors people as well as semi-professional home cooks we
            decided we wanted to change things up, so we began prefetching our homemade salmon cookies, as well we
            strived to have eco friendly packages and have a zero waste product to offer. </p>
