            Welcome to the Sam Bam Cookies page, we would like to introduce you to this amazing concept we have to
            offer, not only is it great for you, but it's also great for the environment. Our products are not only
            amazing cookies but also environmentally safe and have been designed with both the customer, and the
            environment in mind. It all began as a child for me and my wife, and we both loved the ocean that is where
            we meet. One day, I and her had been out for a nice evening walk when we saw a poor fish washed-up on shore
            that had a wrapper from an oreo package stuck halfway in its mouth. Presuming it attempted to swallow it and
            it got caught and stuck, which may have caused it to suffocate. With both being avid outdoors people and
            semi-professional home cooks, we decided we wanted to change things up, so we began prefetching our homemade
            salmon cookies, as well strive to have eco-friendly packages and a zero-waste product to offer.
